<h1>Personal Information</h1>
<div class="text">

<p>My name is Connor Dendle, I'm 25 years old. I was born in NSW Australia, and currently live in a small country town called Merriwa (NSW). My highest level of education is Year 10, however I did attempt an IT course at TAFE when I was younger, but it didn't really peak my interest. I only speak English, I did learn Japanese in High School, but unfortunately cannot remember much of that. </p>

<p>My hobbies mainly include playing video games with my friends, watching TV shows & movies with my fiancé, eating yummy food, and modding my PC. My partner and I have a beautiful rescue dog called Turbo. He’s a staffy, and is the most spoilt fur baby in the whole world.</p>

<p>A few interesting things about myself: I'm a Sagittarius, my favourite colour is pink, I like anime, my favourite movie is Space Jam, and my partner and I are planning our wedding. My video game playtime on steam is currently at 7,537 hours (which is 314 days).</p>

<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<div class="text">
<p>My main interest in IT would have to be to do with games and the development of games. My interest in IT started at a noticeably young age. Basically, raising myself with a computer due to having a single parent who had to work most of the time, which, in my teenage years, grew to spending most of the time gaming with my friends online. As I have grown since then, I have been more interested in working out how games run.</p>

<p>My IT experience currently consists of Tech support/troubleshooting for my family, as well as for myself and my friends’ gaming PC’s. If I had to pick one event that increased my passion for IT, it would have to be making the switch from gaming on consoles to starting on PC. So many doors were opened to me after making that switch, such as modding, trying to optimize performance, and generally being able to customize games more to my liking. Whether that be changing the color pallete with ReShade, forcing games into Flip Model presentation to work better with my GSync monitor to even skipping the grind of most modern open world/JRPGs with tools such as Cheat Engine.</p>

<p>I did not exactly choose RMIT per se, I enrolled in a Bachelor of Information Technology in Games Design and Development through Open Universities Australia, which primarily seems to be through Murdoch, but my Intro to IT course is through RMIT.</p>

<p>I hope to learn how to code more efficiently and a lot tidier as I can get a little messy with coding sometimes, especially after not doing it for a while. I also aspire to learn the ins and outs of game engines, such as Unreal and Unity. I'd also like to be able to contribute more to the projects that I am already following on GitHub.</p>

	<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
		<div class="img"><image src="jobsnapshot-small.jpg" height="600px"/></div>
<div class="text">
<p>My ideal job currently would have to be a <b><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50078933?type=standard#searchRequestToken=a8b44767-4ba5-4280-b0bd-ad8fdaaef6e5" target="_blank">Multiplayer Gameplay Engineer</a></b>.</p>

<p> This position aims to generally cover everything involved with game development and the technologies involved, while specialising into the online network side of things like the net code and ways to reduce latency between players. This is appealing to me as living in Australia we usually get shafted on the network side of things, we either completely miss out on dedicated servers for some games, and due to our poor national network Peer to Peer connections sometimes aren’t the most stable or enjoyable for online gaming. </p>

</br>

<p>This job requires many skills: An expansive knowledge of how to code in C++. Experience in game design in game development in general, with having used Unreal Engine 4 a huge plus. The ability to work with a diverse team across multiple areas and projects, and most importantly, a strong drive and passion to create help create the best game you can.</p>

</br>

<p>As the current limited IT skills that I have: limited coding, no formal IT industry experience, the ability to collaborate with people, no actual game engine knowledge and absolutely no clue on the networking side of things, aren’t up to the skills and qualifications that this job requires. I plan to study to the best of my ability during my Bachelor of Game Design and Development course, to download Unreal Engine 4 and have a poke around at the ins and outs of the engine, in my free time take a stronger look into networking and especially networking to due with gaming.</p>

<h1>Personality Profile</h1>
<div class="imgtwo"><image src="testfour.png" width="250px"/></div>
<div class="texttwo" align="left">
<h3>Logicians | INTP-J</h3> 
<h3>Strengths:</h3>
My personality type has the world view that the world is a machine and being a machine that all the 
parts are connected. We shine in evaluating how these connections are formed and how things 
seemingly unrelated come together in amazing ways. INTP-T’s have a wonderful imagination, are 
extremely open minded, both enthusiastic and objective thinkers while most importantly being 
completely honest and straight forward.

<h3> Weaknesses:</h3> 
Logicians, while being extremely intellectual with a lot of insights into the things that surround them, see their surroundings as a distraction and intrusion on their thoughts, especially when it comes to other people around them. We are extremely shy in social settings, whether that be a complicated social situation such as a party or even just being around our friends. We struggle to let people into both our hearts and minds. As well as this, INTP-T’s can be extremely insensitive, forgetting any kind of emotional consideration. Absent-minded and forgetful, being known to skip both meals and sleep if we are infatuated with a subject or topic. Condescending, being easily frustrated with trying to explain our thoughts and thinking patterns to those who do not understand them, even being known to simplify things to an insulting degree as we struggle to get our point across. INTP-T’s also are known to try to bypass rules and guidelines and to second guess ourselves as we feel rules can constrain us and due to being so open to receiving new information, we can be very indecisive

<h3> Team Composition:</h3> 
INTP-Ts have a very board team composition that ranges from sharing values, interests and a general approach to life, but not always agreeing on everything and with no guarantee of getting along with personality types of INTP, INTJ, INFP and ENTP, Being similar in character but having key differences but a good balance of things in common and opportunities to challenge each other with personalities ISTP, INFJ, ENTJ and ENFP. Not feeling an initial connection but once getting to know each other finding that we have both important things in common as well as things to learn from each other with types ISTJ, ISFP, ESTP and ENFJ. To lastly, having the most potential for conflict and personality clash, but also the best opportunities for growth due to our fundamentally different values and motivations with personality types ISFJ, ESTJ, ESFP and ESFJ.

<h3>Learning Preference: </h3>
My primary learning style, that of the reflector, prefers to stand back and observe. Tending to be overly cautious and taking a back seat to learning. Collecting and analysing information to help reach conclusions, which can both considerable time and effort to develop. We form the bigger picture from using information that we have previously gathered from experience as well as using the information we currently have.

<p><div class="imgfour"><image src="chart.png" width="60%"/></div></p>

<h3>Big 5 Personality Test:</h3>
According to the factors in my Big 5 test results I am: introverted, not super emotionally stable, friendly 
and optimistic, impulsive and disorganised and incredibly open to experience

<p><div class="imgfour"><image src="chart3.png" width="60%"/></div></p>

The results of these tests to me personally are very accurate, I agree with the majority of the points the results make and see many of the qualities reflected in myself, the way I do things and my relationships 
with others. 
These tests may influence my behaviour in a team by people thinking that I’m being quiet and reserved and not working on the project/task at hand when in reality I’m tackling the problem by myself and will share my results with the rest of the team once I’ve come to a conclusion, using the data that the whole 
team has come up with to help us with the end goal.
I should take this into account when forming a team by being upfront with the other members of the team the way in which I tackle problems and by getting the team to decide on a leader that can help keep us all in check and that complements our different personality types

<h1>Project Idea: SocialCare Chat</h1>
<div class="text">
<p><h3>Overview</h3>
The 'SocialCare Chat' project idea is a website, desktop program, and application that would allow the elderly or those with a disability, to video call and interact with their loved ones with ease. The primary focus of this project is to make digital contact with family and friends uncomplicated for those that may struggle with technology. Other features of this project would include an easily understandable user interface and a login page with voice-activated login options, as well as simple games, such as chess, checkers, and card games. There would also be a large focus on the safety, security and privacy of users data, as it is understandable that some of the users using this program may be at risk to the dangers of the internet.
</p>

<p><h3>Motivation</h3>
The motivation behind SocialCare Chat is to simplify technology for those who may struggle with it, as well as make it more accessible. This idea speaks to me on a personal level, as my grandfather suffers from dementia, and is currently in a care facility. Technology is not an easy thing for my grandfather to use, and I would love to be able to develop something that he would be able to use and understand. Since the start of COVID-19, many individuals (including myself), have been unable to see their relatives. Digital technology has been the main way of communication in the current climate, so my motivation for this idea is to make the users feel more confident when using technology as digital technology can sometimes be challenging to use and understand for the elderly or those with a disability.
</p>

<p><h3>Description</h3>
The SocialCare Chat idea is a desktop program, website, and application that would make video calling loved ones simple and stress free for the elderly or those with a disability. There would be minimal navigational tools and buttons, with easily understandable instructions and a basic interface. The main feature of this project would be the ability to make voice and video calls to other users, whilst keeping the user interface very basic and clear. Familiar game options such as chess, checkers and card games would be included. Voice operated commands and login options will be a must, as it is understood that not all users will have full range of motion or sight. The ability to share photos and videos would also be an important feature to include. Alpha and Beta tests would need to be done to determine appropriate user interface colours, buttons, and font sizes. Research into the demographic of the program would be needed to discover and address any further needs that would help them with digital communication. Surveys could be an excellent way to discover and understand what struggles this demographic has with technology, and to help alleviate their concerns. Protocols will be put in place to ensure that this program is developed using safe and secure encryption for user privacy and security. Mental health is another important focus for our userbase, as the ability to contact loved ones so quickly and conveniently could help with feelings of loneliness. There is also potential for future developments, such as extra games, voice or video messages for users, group chats, and more. Growth of the software will be user oriented with feedback being an essential part of any further developments made.
</p>

<p><h3>Tools & Technologies</h3>
The tools and technologies that would be needed to make this project a reality would include the following. For the coding of the application, a text editor (such as Atom, Sublime Text, or Notepad++) would be needed to create the backend. Game development programs, such as Unity, would be needed to develop the interactive game portion of the application. Xcode and Android Studio to develop both an iOS and Android application for use on devices such as mobile phones, tablets, and smart TV’s. Codec’s for the encoding/decoding of both audio and visual streams, used within the chat portion of the application. Finally, a number of work stations (both Mac and Windows/Linux) would be needed to develop this idea on.
</p>


<p><h3>Skills Required</h3>
Some of the skills that may be required to develop this idea, would be the knowledge of how to build a website, as well as the ability to install plugins such as video chat and games. Application development skills would also be incredibly handy for this project, so that it could be ported to a variety of digital platforms and devices. Research skills are also possibly required, to better understand the needs of the projects demographic. Digital privacy would be a vital skill for this project, as you would not want users personal data leaked, hacked, or exposed to vulnerability. 
</p>

<p><h3>Outcome</h3>
I would hope the outcome of this project would be that the elderly and those with a disability could have a less frustrating experience using technology, by easily being able to interact with family and friends in a digital space. The end goal of this software is to provide a safe, fun and comfortable environment for the userbase to become more familiar with using technology as a way to communicate. This software could also help with any potential mental health struggles that the userbase is facing, by allowing them to feel more connected with their family and friends through digital interaction. Finally, I would hope to see this software adopted by care facilities across Australia, for residents to use on any shared devices provided by facilities.
